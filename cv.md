## Code example:

**Task on CODEWARS:** Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.
Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

```JS
function lovefunc (flower1, flower2){
  // moment of truth
   if ((flower1 % 2 == 0 && flower2 % 2 == 1) || (flower1 % 2 == 1 && flower2 %2 == 0)){
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```
